# A Complete Development Environment

AI Code Terminal transforms your browser into a powerful development environment with professional-grade terminal capabilities, integrated file management, and AI assistance—all while maintaining complete privacy through self-hosting.

## Core Features

### Advanced Terminal Multiplexing
**Multiple terminals, multiple layouts.** Create unlimited terminal sessions with sophisticated layout options including tabs, horizontal/vertical splits, and grid arrangements. Each session persists across browser refreshes and network disconnections, ensuring your work never gets interrupted.

### Integrated File Explorer
**Navigate your codebase visually.** Built-in sidebar file browser with syntax-highlighted previews, context menus for file operations, and search capabilities. Preview code, markdown, JSON, and images without leaving the terminal environment.

### Seamless GitHub Integration
**Zero-configuration Git operations.** OAuth-powered GitHub authentication eliminates the need for SSH keys or personal access tokens. Clone repositories with one click, and enjoy automatic Git credential management for push/pull operations.

### AI-Powered Development
**Claude Code pre-installed and ready.** Start using AI assistance immediately with Claude Code built into every workspace. Your API key remains under your complete control—authenticate directly with Anthropic through the secure terminal environment.

### Workspace Management
**Isolated environments for every project.** Each GitHub repository gets its own workspace with isolated terminal sessions, automatic CLAUDE.md context generation, and persistent storage. Switch between projects instantly while maintaining separate development environments.

### Professional Theming
**Customize your environment.** Choose from multiple carefully crafted terminal themes, or customize your own. Consistent theming across terminals, file explorer, and interface elements ensures a cohesive development experience.

## Privacy and Control

### Self-Hosted Architecture
This is not a cloud service—it's software you run on your own infrastructure. Every component runs locally under your control, ensuring your code, credentials, and AI interactions remain completely private.

### Single-Tenant Security
Designed for individual developers. Each installation serves exactly one authorized GitHub user, eliminating multi-user complexity and security concerns. Your development environment is yours alone.

### Open Source Transparency
The entire codebase is open source and auditable. No hidden features, no secret data collection, no vendor lock-in. You can inspect, modify, and extend every aspect of the system.

## Technical Advantages

### Container Isolation
Runs in secure Docker containers with resource limits, read-only filesystems, and non-root execution. Your development environment is isolated from the host system for maximum security.

### Real-Time Performance
WebSocket-powered terminal sessions provide near-native performance with real-time input/output. Advanced terminal features like resizing, scrollback, and session recovery work seamlessly.

### Modern Web Technologies
Built with Vue.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO for reliability and performance. Uses SQLite for lightweight data persistence and modern JavaScript throughout.

## Deployment Options

### Local Development
Perfect for personal use on your laptop or desktop. Quick Docker setup gets you running in minutes.

### VPS Deployment
Deploy to any VPS provider for access from multiple devices. Maintains the same security model with encrypted communication.

### Corporate/Team Use
Self-hosted architecture makes it ideal for organizations requiring complete control over their development infrastructure and data.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** from GitHub
2. **Set up GitHub OAuth** application for authentication  
3. **Configure environment variables** including your authorized username
4. **Start with Docker Compose** - everything runs in secure containers
5. **Access through browser** and begin developing immediately

The complete setup takes about 10 minutes and provides you with a professional development environment accessible from any device while maintaining complete privacy and control over your code and data.
