# Security Overview

Security isn't an afterthought in AI Code Terminalit's built into every aspect of the system. Here's how we protect your code, credentials, and development environment.

## Your Data is Always Encrypted

**Sensitive Information Protected**
All sensitive information, like your GitHub tokens, is protected using strong AES-256 encryption in the database. Even if someone gained access to your database file, they couldn't read your encrypted credentials without the encryption keys.

**Secure Communication Everywhere**
Every connection is encrypted:
- All web traffic uses HTTPS/TLS encryption
- WebSocket connections for your terminal sessions are encrypted
- API calls to GitHub always use secure connections
- No sensitive data is ever transmitted in plain text

## Complete Environment Isolation

**Your Own Private Container**
Each AI Code Terminal instance runs in its own isolated Docker container. This means:
- Your code and processes are completely separated from the host system
- Even if there was a security issue, it's contained within your isolated environment
- No other applications or users can access your development environment
- Resource limits prevent any runaway processes from affecting your system

**Workspace Boundaries Enforced**
All file operations are strictly confined to your workspace directories. The system prevents any security risks by ensuring you can only access files within your designated workspace areas.

## Protection Against Malicious Input

**Input Validation**
The system carefully validates all user input to prevent security attacks:
- File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- All terminal input is sanitized before processing
- Repository names and URLs are verified before cloning
- User data is cleaned and validated at every step

**Safe File Operations**
File uploads, downloads, and operations are restricted to authorized locations and safe file types, preventing malicious files from compromising your system.

## Authentication Security

**Single-Tenant Design**
Only you can access your AI Code Terminal instance. The system is designed for exactly one authorized userno multi-user complexity means no user separation vulnerabilities.

**Secure Session Management**
Your login sessions use industry-standard JWT tokens with secure settings:
- Tokens expire automatically for security
- Sessions are invalidated when you log out
- Failed login attempts are monitored and limited
- Your session data is protected against common web vulnerabilities

**GitHub OAuth Integration**
Authentication happens through GitHub's secure OAuth system:
- No passwords are stored in our system
- Your GitHub credentials never touch our servers
- You can revoke access at any time from your GitHub settings
- OAuth tokens are encrypted and automatically refreshed

## Network Security

**Secure by Default**
The application includes multiple layers of network protection:
- CORS policies prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests
- Security headers protect against common web attacks
- Rate limiting prevents abuse of API endpoints
- All external communications use encrypted channels

**No Unnecessary Exposure**
The system only opens the ports and services it needs to function, minimizing potential attack surfaces.

## Container Security

**Non-Root Execution**
The entire application runs as a non-root user inside the container, limiting potential damage if there was ever a security issue.

**Read-Only File System**
Most of the container file system is read-only, preventing malicious modifications to system files.

**Minimal Attack Surface**
The container includes only the software necessary to run AI Code Terminal, reducing the number of potential security vulnerabilities.

## Regular Security Updates

**Automatic Updates**
When you update AI Code Terminal, you automatically get:
- Security patches for all included software
- Updates to security policies and configurations
- Latest versions of all dependencies with security fixes

**Monitored Dependencies**
All software dependencies are regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities and updated when security issues are discovered.

## Privacy Protection

**Data Minimization**
We only collect and store the absolute minimum data needed for functionality:
- No tracking or analytics data
- No unnecessary logging of your activities  
- Your code and terminal sessions are never stored permanently
- Personal information is limited to what's needed for GitHub integration

**Local Data Control**
Since everything runs locally in your environment:
- You control all data retention policies
- You can delete any data at any time
- No third parties have access to your information
- You can audit exactly what data exists and where

## Transparent Security

**Open Source Advantage**
The entire codebase is open source, which means:
- Security researchers can audit the code for vulnerabilities
- You can verify that security measures work as described
- The security community helps identify and fix potential issues
- No hidden backdoors or secret data collection

**No Security Through Obscurity**
We don't rely on keeping security methods secret. All security measures are designed to be effective even when the implementation is publicly visible.

## Your Role in Security

**Best Practices**
You can maximize security by following these simple practices:
- Keep your AI Code Terminal installation updated
- Use strong, unique passwords for your GitHub account
- Enable two-factor authentication on your GitHub account
- Don't share your Claude API keys or GitHub credentials
- Regularly review active OAuth applications in your GitHub settings

**Incident Response**
If you ever suspect a security issue:
- Change your GitHub password immediately
- Revoke the AI Code Terminal OAuth application from your GitHub settings
- Update to the latest version of AI Code Terminal
- Report security issues to the project maintainers

This comprehensive security approach ensures that AI Code Terminal provides a safe, private development environment where you maintain complete control over your code and data.
